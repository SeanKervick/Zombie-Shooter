   This game inspired by the concept of 'Call of Duty Zombies' whereby
   a zombie enters the game from a random, unkown starting position.
   The zombie then chases or follows the hero character while the hero
   must run away and shoot the zombie to stay alive.
   
   Key Handler:
   
   'a' = LEFT, 'd' = RIGHT, 'w' = UP, 's' = DOWN, to move the hero around the screen.
   
   Other Inputs:
   Move and click mouse to aim left/right & shoot.
   
   Known bugs:
   On start-up, when asked for the player's name, if the user presses cancel the program freezes.
   
   On start-up, after the user has entered their name and presses OK, sometimes a click of the mouse is required to activate the window before the user can shoot or move the hero. 
   
   The user can reverse/change the direction of the bullet if the opposite aim key is pressed while a bullet is moving across screen. This rarely happens as the bullet moves quickly,
   but it is possible to do so.
